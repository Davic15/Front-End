# Front-End-Learning
Road to Front-End Web Developer.

This repository is to learn (and refresh) my knowledge about HTML, CSS and JavaScript to become a Front-End Web Developer.

The books I am reading right now to achieve my goals are:
    1) HTML & CSS Design and build websites. By Jon Duckett.
    2) Javascript & jQuery interactive front-end web development. By Jon Duckett.
